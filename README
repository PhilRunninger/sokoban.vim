The goal of VimSokoban is to push all the packages ($) into the  home area (.) of each level using hjkl keys or the arrow keys. 
The arrow keys move the player (X) in the  corresponding direction, pushing a package if it is in the way and there is a clear 
space on the other side.

Use the 
:Sokoban       - or -    :Sokoban <level num>     (no split window)
:SokobanH     - or -    :SokobanH <level num>   (horizontal split window)
:SokobanV     - or -    :SokobanV <level num>   (vertical split window)
